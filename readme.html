<p><strong>Performance YouTube Player Block for WordPress</strong> (Gutenberg) adds a new block to the WordPress Block Editor that lets you embed YouTube videos while keeping your site fast and performant. Get better scores on Lighthouse/PageSpeed Insights and offer the fastest web experience to your users.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>An essential plugin for web performance optimization</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Make embedded YouTube videos load without render blocking, FOUC or CLS</strong></li>
	<li><strong>No cookies! GDPR compliant and privacy focused</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Made especially for the WordPress Block Editor (Gutenberg)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>BLAZING FAST!</strong> Forget lazy loading and jQuery replacement hacks, Performance YouTube Player Block uses the very latest Web Components technology to load a YouTube embed fast. If you want to make the fastest website possible and want to include YouTube videos, don't let YouTube ruin your Lighthouse/PageSpeed Insights/GT Metrix scores with a slow video embed.</p>

<p><strong>IMPROVE CORE WEB VITALS!</strong> The Performance YouTube Player is rendered on the Shadow DOM, letting the browser focus on other parts of the page render so you get fast loading times. No flashes of unstyled content (FOUC), no CLS issues (Cumulative Layout Shift) and no render blocking time. </p>

<p><strong>PRIVACY FIRST!</strong> Load YouTube without the cookies - no tracking, no cookies, GDPR compliant. Inline with the regulations laid out by the European Union, Performance YouTube is General Data Protection Regulation compliant, and only sends cookies once the user interacts with the video.</p>

<p><strong>WEBP THUMBNAILS</strong> WebP is a newer compression algorithm for images - the average WebP file size is 25%-34% smaller than a JPG. This means your video thumbnails load quicker. WebP image format is now supported by all major browsers.</p>

<p><strong>RESPONSIVE & ACCESSIBLE</strong> Performance YouTube Block is responsive by default (the video resizes for mobile/desktop) and offers many video options over and above the standard WordPress YouTube embed, including looping and hiding controls. Performance YouTube Block is also accessible and SEO friendly.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="item-description__requirements">Nerdy Stuff</h3>
<p>The plugin utilises Web Components and uses two of the main standards of that; custom elements and Shadow DOM. YouTube Performance Block is a component with self-contained HTML, CSS, and JavaScript attached to the page using Shadow DOM. Shadow DOM is one of the three Web Components standards, and using it for the YouTube embed adds improved load speed and avoids an awful FOUC. Using Shadow DOM allows for CSS scoping, DOM encapsulation, better composition and the custom element is resilient and extremely reusable.</p>

<p>The plugin was inspired by Paul Irish's Lite YouTube Embed, forked from Justin Ribeiro's Shadow DOM web component version of the same code. I've updated it, fixed a few problems and fully integrated it in to WordPress Gutenberg, so it just works.</p>

<h3 id="item-description__requirements">Requirements</h3>

<p>The plugin is for WordPress, so requires WordPress to be installed. As it is a Block for the Block Editor (Gutenberg) then you should have WordPress 5.0 or above.</p>

<p>The plugin will not work with Classic Editor installed (as this disables Gutenberg Block Editor)</p>

<h3 id="item-description__faq">FAQ</h3>

<p><strong>Q: My video thumbnail displays as a grey YouTube error thumbnail</strong></p>
<p>A: The video you are embedding doesn't have a webP thumbnail. You can either edit the video on YouTube and resave the thumbnails to generate new thumbnails, or you can use the Disable WebP option in the Blocks settings to display the JPG version. Not all videos use webP images for thumbnails, so older videos need to have their thumbnails regenerated to generate a webP thumbnail.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Can it autoplay the video?</strong></p>
<p>A: This plugin is designed for performance and autoplaying videos ruins performance. It's also annoying! You do not want to autoplay videos for your users if your focus is on performance.</p>
