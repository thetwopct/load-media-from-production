Just use a free plugin?
If you want a free solution, check out "BE Media from Production" from Bill Erickson. However this does not work with all site installs (like Lando), and doesn't work with CSS images and some URLs. Instead it tries to parse image strings in the content and in attachment functions. This means that custom image display functions - like a responsive ACF image function or pulling image files from the theme - won't work.

Just use htaccess?
You could just use a rewrite rule in your .htaccess file, but some local development environments ignore those files (running on nginx). You also have the issue that you could accidentally commit that htaccess file and mess up your live or development site. So this is not an elegant solution.
